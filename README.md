# E-commerce Amazon clone

I made e-commerce logic by cloning amazon.com using react and redux. There are category pages and product page. You can add or delete products from the cart. You can increase the number of products you have added to the cart. I tried to do all this with the redux toolkit global state management logic.

## What's in the project?

+ Developed with ***React***
+ Used ***Redux*** for state management
+ Used ***Tailwind*** for styled
